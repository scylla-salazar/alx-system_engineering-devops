0x09. Web infrastructure design


This project contains links to diagrams representing different web infrastructures.
Its goal is to understand, on a very high-level, how web infrastructures are organized and what are their components.

Tasks
0. Simple web stack
mandatory
A lot of websites are powered by simple web infrastructure, a lot of time it is composed of a single server with a LAMP stack.

On a whiteboard, design a one server web infrastructure that hosts the website that is reachable via www.foobar.com. Start your explanation by having a user wanting to access your website.



1. Distributed web infrastructure
mandatory
On a whiteboard, design a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com.

Requirements:

You must add:
2 servers
1 web server (Nginx)
1 application server
1 load-balancer (HAproxy)
1 set of application files (your code base)
1 database (MySQL)


2. Secured and monitored web infrastructure
mandatory
On a whiteboard, design a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com, it must be secured, serve encrypted traffic, and be monitored.

Requirements:

You must add:
3 firewalls
1 SSL certificate to serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS
3 monitoring clients (data collector for Sumologic or other monitoring services)


3. Scale up

Application server vs web server
Requirements:

You must add:
1 server
1 load-balancer (HAproxy) configured as cluster with the other one
Split components (web server, application server, database) with their own server
You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:
For every additional element, why you are adding it
